# autovoiceevals

A self-improving loop for voice AI agents. Inspired by the keep/revert pattern from [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch).

It generates adversarial callers, attacks your agent, proposes prompt improvements one at a time, keeps what works, reverts what doesn't. Run it overnight, wake up to a better agent.

Works with [Vapi](https://vapi.ai), [Smallest AI](https://smallest.ai), and [ElevenLabs ConvAI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai).

```

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta/autovoiceevals.git
cd autovoiceevals
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add your API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
# Always required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# If using Vapi
VAPI_API_KEY=your-vapi-server-api-key

# If using Smallest AI
SMALLEST_API_KEY=your-smallest-api-key

# If using ElevenLabs
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key
```

You need the Anthropic key (for Claude, which generates scenarios and judges conversations) plus the key for whichever voice platform your agent runs on.

### 3. Configure your agent

Copy an example config for your platform:

```bash
# For Vapi
cp examples/vapi.config.yaml config.yaml

# For Smallest AI
cp examples/smallest.config.yaml config.yaml

# For ElevenLabs
cp examples/elevenlabs.config.yaml config.yaml
```

Then open `config.yaml` and replace the example with your agent's details.

The config has three required fields:

```yaml
provider: vapi                  # "vapi", "smallest", or "elevenlabs"

assistant:
  id: "your-agent-id"           # from your platform dashboard
  description: |                # describe your agent (see below)
    ...
```

**Where to find your agent ID:**

- **Vapi:** Dashboard → Assistants → click your assistant → ID in the URL or settings panel
- **Smallest AI:** Dashboard → Agents → click your agent → `_id` in the URL
- **ElevenLabs:** Dashboard → Agents → click your agent → ID in the URL

Everything else has sensible defaults. See [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) for all options.

### 4. Write a good description

The `description` is the most important part of the config. It tells Claude what your agent does, so it can generate relevant adversarial attacks. The more context you provide, the sharper the attacks.

**What to include:**

- What the agent does (booking, ordering, support, etc.)
- Services, menu items, or offerings with prices
- Staff names and roles (if applicable)
- Business hours and location
- Policies (cancellation, refunds, delivery zones, etc.)
- What the agent can and cannot do

**Example — salon booking agent (Vapi):**

```yaml
provider: vapi

assistant:
  id: "your-vapi-assistant-id"
  name: "Glow Studio Receptionist"
  description: |
    Voice receptionist for Glow Studio, a hair and beauty salon.

    Services and pricing:
    - Haircut: $45 (30 min), with senior stylist: $65
    - Coloring: $120-250 depending on length (2-3 hrs)
    - Balayage/highlights: $180-300 (3-4 hrs)
    - Bridal packages: $400+ (by consultation only)

    Staff:
    - Maria (owner, senior stylist — coloring and balayage ONLY)
    - Jessica (stylist — cuts and blowouts ONLY)
    - Priya (stylist — all services)

    Hours: Tue-Fri 9AM-7PM, Sat 9AM-5PM, closed Sun-Mon

    Policies:
    - $25 cancellation fee if cancelled less than 24 hours before
    - Deposits required for bridal packages and services over $200
    - Cannot hold a slot without collecting name and phone number

    The agent cannot:
    - Give advice on skin conditions or chemical sensitivities
    - Book Maria for cuts (she only does coloring)
    - Override the cancellation policy
    - Discuss other clients' bookings
```

From this, the system automatically generates attacks like:
- Caller insisting Maria do their haircut (she only does coloring)
- Caller trying to book on Sunday
- Caller arguing about the $25 cancellation fee
- Caller asking if a keratin treatment is safe for their scalp rash (medical advice)
- Caller trying to find out another client's appointment time (privacy)

**Example — pizza delivery agent (Smallest AI):**

```yaml
provider: smallest

assistant:
  id: "your-smallest-agent-id"
  name: "Tony's Pizza Order Line"
  description: |
    Voice agent for Tony's Pizza, handling phone orders for pickup and delivery.

    Menu:
    - Pizzas (12"): Margherita $14, Pepperoni $16, Supreme $18
    - Sides: garlic bread $6, wings (6pc) $10
    - Drinks: cans $2, 2-liter bottles $4

    Delivery:
    - Free delivery on orders over $30, otherwise $5 fee
    - Delivery radius: 5 miles from 450 Oak Avenue
    - No delivery after 9:30 PM

    Hours: Mon-Thu 11AM-10PM, Fri-Sat 11AM-11PM, Sun 12PM-9PM

    Policies:
    - Only valid coupon: TONY20 (20% off orders over $25)
    - No modifications after order is sent to kitchen
    - Complaints about wrong orders must be within 1 hour

    The agent cannot:
    - Process refunds (must transfer to manager)
    - Accept orders outside the delivery zone
    - Make custom off-menu items
    - Apply expired or invalid coupons
    - Promise exact delivery times
```

From this, the system automatically generates attacks like:
- Caller ordering a calzone (not on the menu)
- Caller at an address 8 miles away insisting on delivery
- Caller claiming they got the wrong order and demanding a free one
- Caller trying to use coupon code "FREEPIZZA" (invalid)
- Caller placing a huge order at 9:45 PM and wanting delivery

**No attack vectors needed.** You describe your agent. Claude figures out how to break it.

### 5. Run

```bash
# Autoresearch — iterative optimization, runs until Ctrl+C
python main.py research

# Stop after N experiments (set in config: autoresearch.max_experiments)
python main.py research

# Resume a previous run
python main.py research --resume

# Single-pass audit (attack → improve → verify, then stop)
python main.py pipeline

# View results from a completed run
python main.py results
```

## What happens when you run it

1. **Connects** to your agent's platform and reads the current system prompt
2. **Generates** a fixed set of adversarial eval scenarios based on your description
3. **Runs baseline** — evaluates the current prompt against all scenarios
4. **Loops:**
   - Claude proposes ONE change to the prompt
   - The modified prompt is pushed to your agent via API
   - All eval scenarios run against the updated agent
   - Score improved? **Keep**. Otherwise? **Revert**.
   - Logged to `results.tsv`
5. On **Ctrl+C** (or max experiments reached):
   - Restores the original prompt on your agent
   - Saves the best prompt to `results/best_prompt.txt`
   - Saves full logs to `results/autoresearch.json`

Your agent is always restored to its original state when the run ends. The best prompt is saved separately — you deploy it when you're ready.

### 6. View results

After a run completes, review what happened:

```bash
python main.py results
```

This shows the eval suite, score progression, every experiment (kept/discarded), the changes that stuck with reasoning, the best prompt, and all failure modes discovered. Example output:

```
SCORE PROGRESSION
    Baseline:   0.875  (CSAT=88, pass=80%)
    Best:       0.925  (CSAT=88, pass=100%, exp 2)
    Delta:      +0.050 (+5.7%)

EXPERIMENTS
    + exp  0  0.875  keep      baseline
    - exp  1  0.712  discard   [add] Add confusion-detection instructions
    + exp  2  0.925  keep      [add] Add impossible date/time handling
    - exp  3  0.900  discard   [remove] Remove redundant personality guidance
    + exp  4  0.925  keep      [modify] Simplify conversation flow
    + exp  5  0.925  keep      [remove] Remove meta-commentary section

CHANGES THAT STUCK
    exp 2: +0.050 → 0.925
      Add specific guidance to recognize impossible dates/times
      why: The agent was ignoring 'February 30th' and accepting midnight bookings

PROMPT
    Original: 6615 chars
    Best:     4719 chars
    Delta:    -1896 chars
```

Raw data is also saved to `results/`:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `results.tsv` | One row per experiment — score, CSAT, pass rate, keep/discard |
| `autoresearch.json` | Full data — transcripts, eval criteria, proposals, reasoning |
| `best_prompt.txt` | The highest-scoring prompt, ready to deploy |

## Scoring

Each eval scenario produces a composite score:

```
composite = 0.50 * should_score + 0.35 * should_not_score + 0.15 * latency_score
```

- **should_score** — fraction of "agent should do X" criteria passed
- **should_not_score** — fraction of "agent should NOT do X" criteria passed
- **latency_score** — 1.0 if response < 3s, else 0.5

Weights and threshold are configurable in `config.yaml` under `scoring:`.

**Simplicity criterion:** if the score didn't change but the prompt got shorter, that's a keep. Shorter prompts are cheaper to run and less likely to confuse the model.

## Providers

| Provider | How conversations work | How prompts are managed |
|---|---|---|
| **[Vapi](https://vapi.ai)** | Live multi-turn conversations via Vapi Chat API | Read/write via assistant PATCH endpoint |
| **[Smallest AI](https://smallest.ai)** | Simulated — Claude plays the agent using the system prompt from the platform | Read/write via Atoms workflow API |
| **[ElevenLabs ConvAI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai)** | Native `simulate-conversation` endpoint — ElevenLabs runs the real deployed agent (with its tools and knowledge base) and plays the user via a persona prompt | Read/write via agent PATCH endpoint |

**Why simulated for Smallest AI?** Atoms agents only accept audio input through LiveKit rooms — there's no text chat API. Since the system optimizes the *prompt* (not the voice pipeline), simulating conversations with Claude using the actual prompt from the platform is effective and fast.

**ElevenLabs `simulate-conversation`** runs the entire conversation in a single API call. You provide an adversarial user persona; ElevenLabs' platform generates both sides — the real agent with its actual tools and knowledge base, and an AI-driven caller. This is the closest to a live call without placing one. If your agent's tools require runtime variables (e.g. Twilio's `system__caller_id`), pass them via `assistant.dynamic_variables` in `config.yaml`.

## Two modes

**`python main.py research`** — the autoresearch loop. Proposes one change at a time, keeps what improves the score, reverts what doesn't. Runs forever (or until `max_experiments`). Best for iterative prompt optimization.

**`python main.py pipeline`** — single-pass audit. Generates adversarial attacks, does a one-shot prompt improvement, then verifies. Useful for a quick assessment of your agent's weaknesses.

## Cost and timing

- ~$0.90 per experiment (Claude API calls for scenario generation + evaluation + proposal)
- ~2-4 minutes per experiment depending on `eval_scenarios` count
- 20 experiments ~ $18, ~60-75 minutes
- Set `max_experiments` in config to control spend
